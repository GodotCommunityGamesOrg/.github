# Welcome to the Godot Community Games Organization ðŸ‘‹

We are ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}a community of game creators making open source games}}$ together in Godot since October 2024.
<br><br>
We always welcome new members, like you!

<br><br>

# New to the community?

### Joining the community:
1. ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}Email us}}$ at godot.community.games@gmail.com. Please state in your email that you would like to join the group and include your Github username.<br>
4. Head over to our ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}Discord server}}$ (invite link: https://discord.gg/sA9reuEpZH) to join the community discussion.
5. Fill out this ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}email form}}$ (https://forms.gle/WQjPfXPYveGaGzAf7) so you can be given access to the google docs where we keep the ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}Game Design Docs}}$. You will be able to comment on the docs. Emails are only added to the group from this form so please do this. The email list is only used for giving people access to the Game Design Docs and extremely rare community-wide emails.

### Current Events in the community you need to know about:
- We are working on ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}the prototype of our first game}}$, called ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}Lost Pilot}}$, which was voted on in October.
- We are also starting development of an ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}internal online multiplayer community game / virtual hangout space}}$ for everyone in the community to enjoy.
- Planning and development dicussions about both games are happening on Discord.
- Game Design Documents are on google docs. Once you have filled out the email form (in #3 above) you can access the Game Design Docs from Discord in the "Links to Game Design Docs on google docs" chat in the "game-idea-discussions" forum there. These include the Game Design Docs for the current games we are working on as well as the other game ideas that took part in our first game vote in October.
- We will be voting on a logo for this community in the coming weeks. So once you have joined, if you want to take a shot at making a logo please submit it on Discord in the "Logo Design" chat under the "initial-direction-and-planning" forum.

# Goals for this community
- Build and release games together and have fun
- Be a learning resource for Godot game creators
- Be inclusive to new Godot devs just getting started
- Be a place where members can meet other game creators and even form their own groups to build their own personal games outside of this community

# Outline of Community and Development Guidelines
Guidelines still being finalized.

### General Guidelines:
1. Be excellent to each other.
2. Games MUST have dragons (slightly joking)
3. ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}No usage of AI}}$ for assets or code. We have a whole community to make assets and write code.
4. Use of other people's free asset packs is only for prototyping games. 100% of final games are done by contributors to this community.
5. ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}No commercialization of any projects}}$ in this github organization. All games are released online for free. If you want to make commercial games with members of the community feel free to form those groups here, but all your work must be separate from this community and therefore done on your own and off this github.
6. ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}Game ideas can be introduced by anyone.}}$ Game idea introduction and discussion is held on Discord. Game Design Docs for each game idea are handled on the community shared google docs. When one game is finished or the community has the bandwidth to take on another game ${\textsf{\color{#F35774}the community votes on which game idea to choose}}$. The new game then gets a repo and in-depth planning, prototyping, and developing begins.

### Style / Development Guidelines:
1. Follow the official Godot style guide (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
2. Standardized script layout...
3. Game Directory Structure...
4. Documentation / Comments guide...
5. Commit message labeling guide...

### Contributing Guidelines:
1. Use Github Issues for each repo
2. Use forks, feature branches, and pull requests
3. Code review and merge process...
